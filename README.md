# eclipse-image-aligner
An auto-alignment tool for partial and annular solar eclipse images.

## How to set up
### Running Python code
1. Set up an environment with Python and `opencv-python`.
2. Place the files that need to be aligned into the input directory, ensuring that every file has the same image file format.
3. Create an output directory.
4. Run `main.py`. This will open the main window.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
6. Configure each parameter appropriately.
7. Click the 'Do processing' button to start batch processing (the results will be saved in the output directory), or click the 'Preview' button to see the result on a single file (the image will not be saved).
